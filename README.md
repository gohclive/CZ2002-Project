- There is no need to interface with external systems, e.g. Payment, printer, etc.
- Payments areis always successful.
- No need to log in - features
- No graphical interface for selection of rooms.
- The hotel has 48 rooms (of various type) from 02 – 07 level and the room number format is
&lt;2 digit floor level&gt;&lt;running number from 01&gt;, e.g. 0702.
- There will be no refund of fees for early check-out.
